We just released a new patch for SkyBlock, this one includes:  
-   A new Spooky Event
-   New Pumpkin Collection items
-   New Halloween themed Village
-   Zealot Changes
-   Improvements to the Colosseum PvP
-   A new shop: the Bartender
-   New Music
-   Few general changes

# &#x25B6; Spooky Event  
One of the goals of SkyBlock is to be filled with multiple events happening every day, today we are releasing the second Event: **The Spooky Festival**  
This new event takes place at the very end of the Autumn season and will happen every SkyBlock year from now on. First Spooky Festival will happen early Sunday for North America, Noon in Center European Time.  
A SkyBlock year is exactly 5 days and 4 hours so that all events can rotate a bit every year to ensure sure every timezone has access to them at some point.

</details>

The Spooky Festival lasts for 1 hour, during which every monster on public islands will drop either Green and Purple Candies.  
  
The **Fear Mongerer** is a new NPC that appears for 3 hours (1 hour before and after the event) and is located in the Village, where the Baker usually stands.  
Candies can be traded there for a few fun and useful items.  
Also, the top 5000 players to get the most Candies during the event will get rewards! Green candies count for 1 point and Purple ones count for 5 points. Higher-level monsters have better chances to drop Purple Candies.  
  
## Event improvements:  
-   The Events menu now has an "Event Reward" button at the bottom left, if you forget to pick up your rewards at the end of an event, they will get stored there.
-   The Baker now sells a new item, the New Year Cake Bag, for 250k coins. This bag can hold up to 27 of your New Year Cakes and gives +1 HP for every unique Cake stored inside.

## New Spooky Achievements  

-   Participate in killing a Headless Horseman - 5 points
-   Find a Purple Candy - 5 points
-   Kill a Bat Piñata - 5 points

# &#x25B6;  New Pumpkin Collection Items  
The Pumpkin Collection now has 2 new items  
  
## **Training Dummy**:  _Unlocked in Pumpkin Collection V_  
This Training Dummy lets you choose any mob you want to test your weapons on, they have 5000 Health and once they die, they respawn back to full health.  
  
## **Farming Boots**:  _Unlocked in Pumpkin Collection IX_  
Similar to the Lantern Helmet, those boots scale with your Farming Level, the higher it is, the more speed they give you. Useful when farming!  
  
# &#x25B6;  Spooky Village  
![5db1c337902ea.2019-10-24_17.27.32.png](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5db1c337902ea.2019-10-24_17.27.32.png "Spooky Festival Decorations")  
_The Villagers decided to decorate their houses during the Spooky Festival_  

# &#x25B6; Zealot Changes  
The second balancing thread received a lot of positive feedback, so we decided to changes Zealots accordingly:  
-   Added Portal Frames again in the hands of the special Zealots.
-   Zealots with Portal Frames are weaker, they deal less damage and have less Health than regular ones.
-   Instead of Zealots having a small chance of being special when players kill them, they has a small chance of spawning a Portal Frame Zealot close to them.
-   When a player "spawns" a Portal Frame Zealot, they get notified with a strange sound and chat message.
-   The player who "spawned" the Zealot has a few seconds of drop priority on the Summoning Eye, in case someone managed to snipe it just before them.
-   If a player needed more than 1 hit to kill their last regular Zealot, the spawn chances are buffed by 10%.
-   Special Zealots now drop Summoning Eyes when killed by non-direct damage (cleave effect, venomous, fire aspect etc).

Keep in mind that we absolutely need feedback on those changes, please test and let us know if it feels better than before.  
  
We also added the changes to rare drops.  
-   For any rare drop/spawn in the game (1% chance or below), if a player gets unlucky and goes beyond the threshold, the drop chances for that item will be doubled.

# &#x25B6;  Colosseum Changes  
SkyBlock isn't much about PvP, but we still want PvP to be a fun option for players.  
The first step in that direction is to change the current Colosseum:  
-   Damage and Healing now reduced by 75% inside the Colosseum
-   The Arena is now opened, and players can go inside to play FFA
-   1v1 Duels are now in separate rooms
-   Players will not regenerate mana anymore during 1v1 matches
-   Bone Shield does not work against players anymore
-   Guardian Chestplate does not work against players anymore
-   Death messages are now only visible when inside the Colosseum

PVP in SkyBlock is still very experimental. Feel free to give us feedback on what you think is too good (or not good enough!).  
# &#x25B6;  The Bartender  
This NPC located in the Bar finally got his shipment and can start selling useful beverages!  
![5db20ba913097.download-4.png](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5db20ba913097.download-4.png "Drinks anyone?")

Basic Brews are potions you can use instead of Awkward potions. For example, the Decent Coffee would add +8 Speed to any potions crafted with it.  
  
The Brewing stand UI now allows shift-clicking potions!  
# &#x25B6;  3 New Tunes!  
SkyBlock now has 3 new Tunes that play in different locations of the map.  
-   "[Sky of Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3bBQasjbfs&feature=youtu.be)" will now play on Foraging islands
-   "[Abstract Ringing](https://youtu.be/IMMV6JJjHZo)" will now play in the Wilderness
-   "[Hallow Hallow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsjic_fnrZw)" is the theme of the Spooky Event
# &#x25B6; General Changes  
-   Enchanted items can no longer be used to craft vanilla recipes
-   Watchers are now correctly dropping arrows
-   Intimidation Talisman now works with Spiders and Blazes

## **A note on future content**  
<details>
<summary>Click to Read</summary>
The next patch will be 0.7.4, there are still a few features that are close to being released, it'll be a smaller patch and you can expect 0.7.4 to be released within 1 to 2 weeks.  
  
Currently, our 2 biggest projects are:  
  
**1/ Dungeons**  
We know - everyone wants dungeons. We really want to make Dungeons as great as we can.  
The difficulty should scale from mid-game players to way beyond the current late game.  
Every room of the Dungeons should matter, and mobs will never be boring.  
  
Dungeons will feel simple, however, they will have a lot of exploration and fun mechanics to learn. Players should feel like they are getting better at Dungeons the more they play.  
  
We are making good progress, and we hope to finish and release it as soon as possible.  
  
**2/ Skills**  
Most of the progression in SkyBlock starts with Collections, and many Skills don't really offer any progression past level 5.  
  
Skills were not intended to be that important, mostly because some of them have very repetitive gameplay. Foraging, for example, currently consists of only really chopping wood.  
  
In the future we are going to go over the current Skills one by one and improve their gameplay, which will allow us to give them more meaningful progression.  
  
Of course, we have many many more plans for SkyBlock, but we will talk about those in a later thread.
