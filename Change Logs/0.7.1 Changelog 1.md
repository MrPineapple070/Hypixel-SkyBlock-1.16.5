-   **Moderation tools**  (coming soon)
-   A full rewrite of our  **Profile system,** which will fix a lot of profile problems and allow players to kick co-op members. If you missed it, you can read all the profile changes >[here](https://hypixel.net/threads/september-10-profiles-update.2311548/)<.
-   **Bug Fixing**
