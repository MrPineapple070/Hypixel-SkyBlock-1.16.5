Hello.  

Some changes to Dark Auction:  
  
## Dark Auction now takes your coins on bid.  
This means you can't troll DA anymore by putting very high bid and leaving.  
If you put a high bid and leave, you will win the item and it will be delivered to your Jerry.  
Similarly, if you put a losing bid and leave, you will be refunded in Jerry.  
  
## Dark Auction now has a queue and takes the richest players first.  
When you talk to Sirius in the hub, it registers you in the queue instead of sending you directly.  
  
At the moment we have 330 player slots in the Dark Auction.  
We'll monitor the amount of players who get denied entry (atm it's about 150) over the week and we may add more slots.

Enjoy and praise Jerry.
