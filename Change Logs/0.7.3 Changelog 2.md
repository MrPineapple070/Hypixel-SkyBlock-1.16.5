Hello,  
  
We just rolled a small patch that changes the requirements of the top 1 and top 10 rewards.  
  
The top 1 reward now only requires to finish the event with at least 2400 Points  
The top 10 reward now only requires to finish the event with at least 2000 Points  
Other rewards are unchanged.  
  
The goal is to make the top of the leaderboard less competitive, to give solo players a chance to claim those rewards.
