Hi!  
  
There was recently the Pets update: [https://hypixel.net/threads/skyblock-patch-0-7-6-pets-and-quality-of-life.2616027/](https://hypixel.net/threads/skyblock-patch-0-7-6-pets-and-quality-of-life.2616027/)  
  
## Services Reliability  
On the weekend of its release, in all the excitement we saw issues with communication between the game and its services. To relieve those issues, we fast-tracked **backend** updates to the Bank and Auction House.  
Auction House: [https://hypixel.net/threads/auction-house-escrow.2634112/](https://hypixel.net/threads/auction-house-escrow.2634112/)  
Bank had a similar fix, but more uh... obscure.  
  
## Bug fixes  
Also, here are bugs we fixed since pets:  
-   Stop players from stealing horse pets
-   Fix Wolf Pet Pack Leader sometimes not giving buff
-   Don't show "Mystery Egg Recipe" twice in the chicken collection
-   Can't place Enchanted Sponge, Enchanted Wet Sponge and Enchanted Snow block (losing them) anymore
-   Fixed Melody's Hair interacting with pressure plates and making everyone deaf
-   Cannot tame Wolf slayer anymore
-   Fixed Stubborn Giver achievement
-   Fixed co-op salvage dropped items counting towards collection
-   Fixed Combat XP buffs (pots & pet) not counting towards Slayer quests
-   Made it so Haste Ring doesn't override better haste
-   Fixed mushroom minion upgrade button not counting towards unique minions
-   Updated the map picture in the hub
