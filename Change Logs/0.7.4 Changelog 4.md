Hello.  
  
We have a few extra changes related to the Piggy Bank:  
  
## 1. Added "Cracked" Piggy Bank  
To reduce how often you have to repair the item, the piggy bank now cracks on first death before breaking on a second death.

## 2. Reduced the cooldowns of the Personal Bank  
Before: 2hr, 1hr, 20m, no cd  
After: 1hr, 20m, **5m**, no cd  
## 3. Added "Personal Bank Item"  
It's just like the Personal Bank, but less clicks.  
You unlock this item with the personal bank at Emerald VI, craftable for cheap.
