Hello.  
  
## Slayer Bosses  
-   Increased Tier IV boss XP from 400 -> 500 XP, reduced Tier IV kills requirement by 25%.
-   Reduced Sven Packmaster's top speed a lot cause it was ridiculous.
-   Reduced Revenant Horror speed boost a bit when hit.
-   Increased the time before bosses regen when out of combat by 40%.
-   Fixed boss aggro mechanic so it doesn't start running way out.
-   Fixed the boss teleporting way too much on the player under certain conditions.

## Related to Bosses

## Gear  
-   Fixed +50% healing wand buff on the revenant armor set.  
-   Fixed Shaman sword reducing wolf damage waay too much.
