Hello,  
  
As you probably noticed, we were running lag tests during this event to figure out what part of the event was the culprit.  
The good news is that we have a pretty good idea what was causing it, so hopefully the next events should be lag free.  
  
Gameplay wise, we didn't have much time to roll many changes since yesterday, but we'll try to roll another Winter event patch before the next one.  
  
Here are some of the things we want to work on:  
-   Reduce a bit the knockback from magma cubes
-   Increase the duration of the exp potions to 12 minutes instead of 5
-   Start the volcano animation earlier, so only the end of the animation remains when the event starts
-   Add more powerups in front of the village
-   Fix Jingle Bells working on Magma Cubes
-   Fix Venomous working on Liquid Hot Magma
-   Add more gifts to the piles
-   Show the timer until the next round in the scoreboard
-   Fix Exp potions not working with Slayer content
-   Make the rounds a bit longer and waiting time between rounds shorter
-   Remove some bad rewards from Red Gifts
-   Add new items to the gift rewards
-   Make sure Liquid Hot Magmas don't target players close to cannons
-   Buff the Snow Suit to give 2x stats on the island
-   Make sure Cannons don't damage pets
-   Fix the 1000 Gift achievement, currently not working

Most of the team is currently spending time with their families, so the patch might be delayed
