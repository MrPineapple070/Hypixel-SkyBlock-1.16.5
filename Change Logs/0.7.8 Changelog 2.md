Hello!  
  
We've introduced a new feature to SkyBlock: Fast Travel.

Menu accessible from the previous "Warp to: Hub" button  

Your private island is always accessible and you may now **warp directly to the hub** from any island.  
_(This feature was initially introduced to increase server performance, but we did more...)_  
  
You may now warp to all of the different islands in SkyBlock directly from the Fast Travel menu.  
Each warp is unlockable using **travel scrolls**:

Scroll crafted from a recipe unlocked in the End Stone collection  

But wait, there's more!  
[If you have MVP+](http://store.hypixel.net/), you gain access to Epic scrolls which lead to extra convenient locations across SkyBlock.

Enjoy.
