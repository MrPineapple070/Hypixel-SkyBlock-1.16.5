# &#x25B6; Guesting
Time to make your island look pretty!
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d24864bb6224.download-7.png "Visiting Players")
-   You can now visit the Islands of other players. /visit <name>
-   There is now an "Island Settings" menu in your SkyBlock Settings (SkyBlock Menu).
-   You can decide who can visit your island (Friends, Guild, Everyone, Nobody).
-   When visiting an island, you can't die nor take damage.
-   Guests can't break anything on your island, can't use abilities or open any chest or else.
-   By default, guests can't pick up the items that you drop on the ground, but you can enable it.
-   Guests can use the chat normally.
-   You can visit the islands of other players even if they are offline.
-   By default, we are limiting the total amount of guest on the island to 1.
-   If your island has at least 1 VIP, the max amount of guests on the island at the same time is 3.
-   If your island has at least 1 MVP, the max amount of guests on the island at the same time is 5.  
-   If your island has at least 1 MVP++, the max amount of guests on the island at the same time is 7.  
-   MVP++ players can still visit an island even if the island is full (up to a max of 10 guests on the island).
-   You can go back to the hub, or go back to your island using the SkyBlock Menu.
-   Jerry now has a Guesting Menu, where you can find info and also access your Settings.
-   Visits are  **OFF**  by default, if you want players to join your island turn it  **ON**  in your Settings.

This is only the testing phase of Guesting, we have many more plans for the future. Players will be able to create parkours and implement cool ways to interact with your guests.

# &#x25B6;  New Boss Loot Mechanics
We want looting to be fun and fair at the end of the Boss Fights.  
The Magma Boss is currently the only real Boss of the game, but this system would be used for future boss fights as well.  
  
## Loot mechanics:  
Bosses still drop the items on the ground, but players can only see their own loot.  
The more damage you deal to the Boss, the more loot you will gain from the Boss.  
Even if you are the top 1 Damage, you might not get the best item, but you will have better odds of getting the best item.  
Even if you did not get the best item, you will be compensated with more loot.  
Overall the more damage you deal, the more loot you will gain, but it does not mean you'll get the best items.  
Everyone who participated in the fight (at least dealt 1 damage) will get at least 1 Fragment, used to craft the Armor from the Boss.  
At the end of the Boss Fight, you can now see your damage ranking and how much you dealt.  
  
## Magma Boss changes:

-   The Magma Boss now has 60000 Health
-   It now drops a lot more overall loot, enough for everyone.
-   It can now drop pieces of the Ember Armor. (Mid game armor)
-   It can now drop Ember Fragments (can be used to craft Ember Armor).
-   There are a few gameplay elements on the map that can give you a very accurate indication of the next time the Magma Boss will spawn...if you know what those are.

Let us know what you think about those new mechanics! If you like them, we will keep them for future fights!

# &#x25B6; New Collection Rewards
## Teleport Pads  
_Unlocked in Ender Pearl Collection 7_
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d24d4a14e77b.download-1.png "Teleport Pads")
Very much like the Launch Pads, Teleport Pads can be placed on your island and right clicked to setup.  
You can place up to 12 of them on your private island.  
Each one of them is assigned a different color, and each one can be linked to the color of another Teleport Pad.  
Example: You can set up Yellow Teleport Pad to always go to Red Teleport Pad, and then set up Red to always go to Green, and set up Green to always go to Yellow. You went full circle!  
  
## Hot Potato Book  
_Unlocked in Potato Collection 8_  
When you place a Hot Potato book in an Anvil with a weapon or armor, it'll permanently apply stats on that piece of gear forever, for free.  
Applying a Hot Potato Book does not cost any level, and does not add any anvil penalty to the item, it's free!  
Hot Potato Books gives +2 Weapon damage and +2 Strength on Weapons, and +2 Defense +4 HP on Armor pieces.  
The one downside is that you can only use Hot Potato Books 10 times maximum on any piece of gear!  
  
## Woodcutting Crystal  
_Unlocked in Birch Log Collection 8_  
You can place this Woodcutting Crystal nearby your Foraging Minions and they will start working 10% faster.  
It has a range of 12 blocks.  
  
## Greater Talisman Bag  
_Unlocked in Redstone Collection 10_  
This upgrade will increase the size of your Talisman Bag from 15 slots to 21 slots.  
  
## Hard Glass  
_Unlocked in Sand Collection 7_  
This special Glass can't be broken by explosions. Perfect for Ghasts!

# &#x25B6; Personal Leaderboards
SkyBlock isn't really about competition, but we still think players should be able to see their personal rankings.
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d24f3aa9ab35.download-3.png "Personal Leaderboards")
You can now find your personal leaderboards in the SkyBlock Menu!
<details>
<summary>Click here if you want more information on where to find them</summary>
We do not want leaderboards to always show in the Menu, so first, you have to hover your mouse on either the Diamond Sword or the Painting in either the Skill Menu / Collection Menu
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d249e2266438.download-10.png "Skills")
It will then tell you to click on it to show the rankings.  
Once clicked, you will see the rankings of each Skill or Collection below each respective one.

![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d249ea56c708.download-9.png "Ranking")
Time to rank up!
</details>

# &#x25B6; Shop Improvements
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d248943cef39.download-8.png "Shop Trading Options")
Finally!  
  
You can now right-click on items in the shop to buy in bulk.  
This does not work on armors, weapons, talismans, potions or enchanted books.

# &#x25B6;  Enchantment Changes
## New enchantment: Telekinesis  
Telekinesis can be applied to Swords, Bows, Pickaxes, Axes, Shears, anything!  
Whenever you mine an ore, cut wood, shear a sheep or kill a mob, the loot directly goes into your inventory. (Does not work on Boss monsters)  
  
## Enchanted Book Recipe changes  
Crafting level 1 Enchanted Books was almost never a good idea.  
We changed all the collections to reward higher level books instead, and scale the difficulty of the recipes appropriately. Hopefully, book recipes are interesting to craft now!

## Enchantment mechanics changes  
In preparation for end-game content coming in the next few weeks we have decided to balance enchantments.  
Enchantments will no longer buff each other, they will only apply to the base damage of the weapon.  
This is a pretty big change, as it will lower the damage of items by a lot, but at least it will allow us to add new enchantments later, without having to worry about them buffing all other enchantments.  
Because of that, we might need to buff some of the weapons in the game, let us know what you think about it!

<details>
<summary>Clicks here if you want more information on those changes</summary>
Until now, every single enchantment that would add a % damage to your weapon, would not apply directly on the base damage, but on all the damage until then.  
Example before update:  
Let's take a sword with 100 damage, with Sharpness 5, First Strike 4, Cubism 5.  
The first hit on a Magma Cube would deal:  
100 &times; 1.25 &times; 2 &times; 1.5 = 375 damage.  
  
After those changes, it will deal:  
100 &times; (1 + 0.25 + 1 + 0.5) = 275 damage.  
  
As you can see it'll heavily reduce the damage of your first hits, and reduce the other hits by a decent amount.  
But at least now we can add new enchantments without breaking the balance completely!
</details>

## Execute and Snipe changes  
Execute enchantment nerfed from 1% to 0.2% per missing health %, but it now scales to level 5, instead of 3.  
Snipe enchantment nerfed from 5 to 10 blocks distance.

## Frost Walker changes  
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d24d00c2bb87.download.png "Fishing")
_Nice try nerd_  
Frost Walker will no longer work next to a bobber, peace is restored.

# &#x25B6;  Accidental Drop Protection​
When clicking the drop key while holding a Weapon, Armor, Talisman, Fishing Rod, Tools or any Epic/Legendary/Special items, you will have to click the drop key twice in a row if you want to drop the item.  
Otherwise, the item won't drop and you will see this lovely message:
![](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5d24f12bccdf0.download-2.png "Drop Protection")
