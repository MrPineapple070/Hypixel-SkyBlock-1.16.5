Hello,  
  
The first Winter Event just ended, we found a lot of issues and are going to fix many.  
-   The lag is already fixed, should be much better for the next event
-   32 players per server made the game too easy, we are reducing the amount of players per instance
-   Gifts will be rewarded per account from now on, multiple profiles will only get 1 of each gift
-   Gifts are giving too many books, players only need a few of them
-   Gifts are rewarding too many coins total, some values will be tuned down
-   The bank building will be changed to make it more clear that it is a bank
-   It will be made more clear that there are multiple rounds
-   Snow Suit will gain defensive stats
-   Aspect of the Dragon ability (and similar items) won't work on magma cubes anymore
-   Players with less damage dealt will have reduced rewards
-   Snow Minions I not being unlocked by the gift will be fixed
-   Will add compactor and super compactor to Snow Minions
-   Fixed Jerry trying to also ruin the New Years event
-   EXP Potions should not be upgradable

Unrelated:  
-   Gift the Fish lore will be fixed
-   Frozen Blaze suit lore will be fixed (does not show slowness and damage right now)
-   Perfect Armor tier 8 back to Legendary tier
