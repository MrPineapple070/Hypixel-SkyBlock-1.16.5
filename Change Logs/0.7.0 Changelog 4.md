Hey!  
  
We released an update to the SkyBlock profiles system.  
This profiles patch mostly focuses on the backend systems, but there's a few features we slipped in.  
  
We added a new Co-op Management menu.  
You can access it by using /coop while already on a co-op profile:

The menu includes a new co-op kick feature (also can use /coopkick):

When kicking a player, a vote is held amongst the other partners. Once **everyone** agrees, the target player will be removed from the profile. You may then pickup their belongings using /coopsalvage.  
  
In order to keep track of players who transited through the profiles, there's a new "Historical Members" button:

Within the historical members you can see extra info about their history, like when they left and why.

Finally, in the Co-op Management menu you can view the status of your co-op partners.  
It shows live info like their current island, whether they're playing on this profile and their online status.  
It also includes extra info about their profile like their purse, equipped armor, collection contributions and how long they've been in the co-op.
