Hello,  

It's the holidays in SkyBlock, the Winter Event is here, along with a few other changes!  

As a quick note, SkyBlock is still in maintenance, read more about that [here](https://hypixel.net/threads/scheduled-maintenance-december-18th.2501844/).  
  
# &#x25B6;  Winter Island  
![5df9443af3d5d.Jerrysworkshop.png](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5df9443af3d5d.Jerrysworkshop.png)
 
The 3rd permanent Event of SkyBlock is out, in the form of an island.  
Like always, we won't spoil much about the island, but here is all the necessary information:  
  
The Winter Island is opened during the entire **Late Winter** month, every SkyBlock year (roughly 11 hours straight every 5 days and 4 hours).  
You can access the island from the SkyBlock Menu, or your own Jerry, or from the Jerry located at the **Event Stand in the Village** during the entire month.  
While the island is pretty calm, for one-hour things get pretty chaotic, as the workshops are under attack, defend them at all costs! For that you will need to talk to **Frosty** at the entrance of the island, he will reward you his **Snow Cannon**, very useful!  
  
## Gifts!  
The Event, and the rest of the island, mostly reward **Gifts**.  
There are 3 types of gifts, all with similar rewards, but Green has slightly better rewards than White, and Red Gifts are the best ones.  
To open a Gift: You can go to any player, except your co-op members, and **right-click them with a gift in hand, you'll both get the rewards**!  
  
## Bonus Events  
On top of the first 2 Winter Events, we are scheduling another **4 Bonus Events** to make sure everyone has a chance to participate:  
![5dfa991fa18a1.schedule2.png](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5dfa991fa18a1.schedule2.png)
  
The Winter Island will only be opened 3 hours during Bonus Events, from 1 hour before the event to 1 hour after.  
As always, you can see the time schedule of all Winter Events in your **Calendar Menu**.

**Note on future content**

As the end of the year approaches, most of the team will take at least a few days off to spend with their families.  
After the Winter Event, Dungeons are our last top priority and are working hard on finishing them within a reasonable timeframe.  
Our biggest mistake was announcing them very early, but the pressure won't impact the quality standards we set for them.  
Dungeons are not there to give players a few weeks or months of content, they are designed to give you unlimited content.  
Dungeons are randomly generated, you will never play the exact same dungeon twice, and they have multiple difficulty tiers that should scale way beyond the current late game.  
  
[Here](https://youtu.be/haiIvIspBgA) is a teaser of our new mob system:
<i>Don't pay attention to the map or their names, or my awful performance.</i>  
  
This allows us to create very interesting mobs, I'm sure you can imagine all the possibilities.  
Each mob can have their own settings, different behaviors or personalities, they could even look like you!  
  
This video is only a teaser, we improved them since the video and will keep improving them for years.  
In the clip we showcased multiple details, those are the most important ones:  
Those mobs learned how to sprint jump, but only jump when they need to.  
Their pathfinding is greatly improved, sometimes even better movements than real players.  
They are able to use many vanilla and SkyBlock items correctly and are getting better and better with bows.  
They can strafe and have different strafing patterns depending on situations.  
  
If you want to see a glimpse of the new system, we implemented a more basic monster during the Winter Event, a horde of them.  
  
We are spending a lot of time and energy on R&D with random generations, smart monsters and other things, but in the end, it'll be worth it. Production took months but once done, the game will be better forever. We don't plan on making the second Dungeon right after this one, but once we start working on the second dungeon, production should be a LOT faster.  
  
Still no ETA on release, but we can see the end of the tunnel! Sorry for the wait.  
  
Over the next few days/weeks we will also spend some time improving the Winter Event and finish some of the coming soon features.
