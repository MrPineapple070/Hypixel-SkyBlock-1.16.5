# What’s next?
Few weeks ago, we made the decision that it was time to publicly test SkyBlock. That is, even if we felt like we needed more time to polish a few features and reach higher quality. The decision to release early was because we believe that letting the community be part of the development early on is critical to its future updates. Also, we were having quite a bit of fun already, so why not!

Reality is, the Hypixel team spent the last 6 months working on SkyBlock and had no idea if the community would love our version of SkyBlock. Was it worth investing more time into a game that we had no idea would work or not? It was a big gamble for us to spend so much energy on it in the first place, it was time to get the players involved as well.

The success of SkyBlock is mind-blowing. In the past few days, Hypixel has seen the fastest growth it has ever experienced. The game is twice as popular as Bed Wars right now, we could not have predicted that.

With the massive success of SkyBlock, we are going to do a few things;
* Release constant small bug patches every few days.
* Release content updates on Tuesdays (not every Tuesdays, but most!)
* Improve existing features that feel low quality.
* Focus on new high quality content, not quantity.
* Implement monetization that is fair and fun (no P2W).

To expand on the topic of monetization, it’s important to understand that SkyBlock has a few problems right now;
* SkyBlock servers uses twice as much resources (2x expensive)
* It doesn’t have a traditional lobby, so it does not participate in the global monetization of Hypixel.
* Currently has 0 monetization.

We have a few key points for Monetization that we want to share with our community;
* SkyBlock will never have P2W, ever. Even if the EULA updates and allows for it.
* Make current ranks (VIP,VIP+,MVP,MVP+,MVP++) have most of the features.
* No loot boxes in SkyBlock, we want to find better ideas, something new.
* It has to be engaging to players, they must interact with it and have fun.

We are aiming to release our monetization content in July. That will allow us to order more servers and expand our team as soon as possible. In the meantime, we will have to cap the player count from time to time.

As for game content, we are planning to have tons of new boss fights (with interesting mechanics), big events, more dangerous islands to explore, new quests, more skills, more items, museum, more recipes, guests to your private islands, dungeons with scaling difficulty system, end game progression features, island furniture, replayability features and so much more.

In conclusion, your feedback and suggestions are super important and have already affected the future of the game, keep it coming!
