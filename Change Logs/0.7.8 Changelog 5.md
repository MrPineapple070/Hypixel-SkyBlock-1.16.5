Hello,  
  
Today I bring you quality of life changes for the Endstone Protector boss, pet balancing and bug fixes, and some general fixes/QOL changes.  
  
## Protector Changes  
-   Drop chances are now influenced by "Zealots Contributed" which caps at 100 representing how many zealot kills you contributed to spawning the boss
    -   A high number of zealots contributed is required to get rare drops
    -   You can see how many zealots you contributed via the summary after the boss has been defeated
    -   **Developer Note**: this feature was added to provide a more fair experience and help prevent lobby-hopping in order to kill the boss without helping spawn it
-   Added more spawn points
-   Added more messaging/sounds
-   Added crystal fragments to the drop table for top 5 damagers
-   Changed poppies to Endstone Roses
    -   These roses can be collected or sold to a shop

## Quality of Life Changes  
-   **Removed potion limit**
    -   **Developer Note**: potion limits will play a part in dungeons and may play a part in other areas of the Skyblock world in the future
-   **Removed monster kill combat XP on private islands**
    -   **Developer Note**: having private island mobs giving combat XP has promoted too much abuse and was not the way the combat skill was intended to be trained
