## Repelling Candle in action
We've added a new item called Repelling Candle.  
It's available in the Acacia collection for cheap.  
  
It stops unwanted (non-minion) mobs from spawning on your island.

Right-click the candle on the ground to open its menu

The candle can be configured a little bit:  
-   Pick one of 14 available colors
-   Select a radius (10 blocks, 50 blocks or infinite)
-   Toggle the extra particles (cosmetic, to reduce lag)
  
## Buyback History  
We've updated the NPC merchants' item buyback functionality.  
The NPCs will now remember up to 10 items that you sold.  
You can buyback those items across merchants and servers.  
The items are saved for up to 1 hour.

## Bat Firework  
Also, we changed how the Bat Firework works.  
The player using the item will immediately gain 5-10-15-20-25-(rarely, 64) purple candies.  
Instead of shooting the bats, they will each drop a bunch of green candies.  
We **had** to implement this change to help with server performance so bear with us.  

## Other fixes:  
-   Fixed "Travel Scroll to the Blazing Fortress" costing Enchanted Glowstone BLOCKS instead of DUST
