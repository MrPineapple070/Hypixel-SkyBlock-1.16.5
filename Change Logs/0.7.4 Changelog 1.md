We just released a new patch for SkyBlock, this one includes:  
-   A revamp of the Foraging island
-   Few general changes
  
# &#x25B6;  Foraging Island  
The Foraging Islands were too small, players were struggling to gather wood, and the islands were overall not living up to our gameplay standards, however cute they were.  
  
Like mentioned in a previous patch, one of our goals is to make all current skills interesting. This is the first step towards making Foraging fun, the second step will include a second tier of Foraging Island (one of our projects in 2020).

As per usual, we won't spoil what the Island contains, but you can expect interesting content for everyone.  
  
There are 8 new NPCs on the Foraging island; we thought since we're remaking the island, we'd give everyone a good reason to explore it. As such, there is a rather large variety of fun new quests around it.  
  
Let us know what you think!  
  
# &#x25B6;  New Furnitures  
We added 26 new Furnitures in this update, those are all unlocked through Carpentry levels 11 to 25.

# &#x25B6;  General Changes  
## Fairy Soul Tracker and Completed Quests  
You can now see how many Fairy Souls you unlocked on each island, from your Quest Menu.

Also, all Completed Quests will now be stored in a new submenu, inside the Quest Menu

## New Boomer NPC  
You can now find Walter in the Gunpowder Mines, he sells a new item that will become very useful in the future!  
  
## New Village Shop  
Tailoring isn't a feature just yet, but the shop now exists! It currently only sells classy suits. Not very useful...  
  
## Reaper Scythe changes  
Abilities and enchantments won't target/damage Desecrated ("allied" mobs) when they shouldn't.  
Desecrated will now target enemies damaged by their owner's projectiles.  
Desecrated's damage output is multiplied by 1/5 (deal 20% of damage)  
  
## Other changes  
-   Tarantula Minion 1 is now given on Spider Slayer 5.
-   Revived Heart is now wearable at Zombie Slayer 6, instead of 7.
-   Scorpion Bow is not affected by damage multipliers anymore.
-   The End Race (and similar races) now have particle effects showing the path.
-   Fixed a bug related to touchscreen mode.
-   Fixed an issue related to Training Dummies.
-   Fixed stealing barriers and end portal frames from rune pedestal.
-   Fixed Red Claw, Spider, Hunter, Zombie and Healing talisman reforges stacking with their upgraded versions.
-   Fixed the Pets Menu not showing up for those who unlocked a Skeleton Horse.
-   Fixed stat buffs for Wolf Slayer & LVL 8,9 of all slayers, works retroactively.
-   Fixed NPCs who were being impolite and didn't look at the player.
-   Fixed the mana regen buff for Manaflux and Overflux.
-   Reduced the shop click cooldown by a lot.
-   Your Jerries played Battle Royale and only 1 is left, the best one.

## A note on future content:  
<details>
<summary>Click to Read</summary>
Yesterday was our first testing session of Dungeons, there is still a lot of work to do, but we had fun! We believe that Dungeons are going in the right direction. We might show you some of the features before release, but we won't spoil much!  
  
Dungeons still have no ETA, big projects like this take longer every time we have new ideas. In theory, the longer it takes the better you should expect Dungeons to be. There is a lot of hype for Dungeons, and we really want to ensure we make it as best as we can.  
  
Dungeons will be coming up with SkyBlock 0.8. There will be at least one more update before that (0.7.5). What it will contain is not something we can talk about just yet.  
  
The Item Balancing Thread will be created today, don't forget to check the forums again later today!
