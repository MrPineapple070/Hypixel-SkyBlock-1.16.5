Hello,  
  
We are releasing a SkyBlock Patch today, including Pets and tons of Quality of Life changes.  
There is also an update at the bottom of the thread on Dungeon progress, keep reading!  
  
# &#x25B6;  Pets  
We at Hypixel, love our pets. Today we are introducing Pets all throughout the game: Pets you can craft, Pets you can loot from monsters, and even some other pets.  
  
## But first, what is a Pet?  
Pets are creatures you can summon, they will follow you around and give you stats and perks.  
When you unlock a new Pet, it will be level 1. By playing SkyBlock with your pet, it will level up to a maximum of level 100. Pets are linked to a skill - for example, a farming pet will mostly earn experience through farming. Leveling a pet will increase the stats it gives you, as well as improve its perks.  
Pets can be different rarities, from Common to Legendary. A higher rarity pet will give you more perks!  
  
There were 2 pets in the game already who have been incorporated into this system, and we have now added 26 new ones. This means there are now **28 pets**!  
Twelve of these can be crafted, with recipes unlocked in the Collections.  
Each recipe will require Enchanted Eggs, and reward you with a Common, Uncommon or Rare pet.  
Super Enchanted Eggs can be used with the same recipes, instead of Enchanted Eggs, to craft Epic or Legendary pets.  
  
Some Pets are rewarded from Fishing, killing monsters, slaying bosses, or from the Hypixel Zoo.

Oringo comes from a very far place, every SkyBlock year during the first 3 days of Early Summer, to sell exotic Pets from foreign islands.  
The Pets are random every year, but if you miss them don't worry, they will come back!  

# &#x25B6;  Quality of Life changes  
  
## Quick Crafting  
This new VIP and above feature changes your Crafting Menu and shows the 3 most expensive items you can currently craft, with the items you currently have in your inventory. It currently works with almost all items in the game but does not include shift-clicking just yet. You will need to have at least combat level 5 to unlock this feature, as we do not want to confuse new players too much.

## Dungeon Progress  

<details>
<summary>Click to read more</summary>
We would like to apologize for the lack of information coming from us lately regarding Dungeons; the community is due for a progress update on what we are currently working on.<br>
<br>
When we started working on Dungeons we had several ideas on how it should be implemented, and we decided to go with the most impressive one as we believe it'll be worth it in the long run. What this meant sadly was that SkyBlock would not have major updates for a while. However, we really wanted to bring you guys what we think is the best version of what SkyBlock Dungeons can be.<br>
<br>
While we rarely spoil projects ahead of time, today we'll explain what SkyBlock Dungeons are:<br>
<br>
<b>Randomly generated</b><br>
Dungeons are small randomly generated labyrinths. Some things will change, but some other aspects will remain consistent because we want to make sure the difficulty is approximately the same every time, good or bad luck should not be involved.<br>

<img src="https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5e503cfcc87c0.DungeonRoom.png" data-url="https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5e503cfcc87c0.DungeonRoom.png" class="bbImage" data-zoom-target="1" style="" alt="5e503cfcc87c0.DungeonRoom.png" title="" width="" height="" loading="lazy">
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128)">Work in progress</span></span><br>
<br>
<b>Team Experience</b><br>
While Solo mode may be released eventually, we want to encourage players to find a party and develop a strategy together before entering. Some of the best memories players can make, are with their friends, having an adventure together. Hypixel used to be known for its adventure maps many years ago, this is the experience we want to bring back, and more. There is a strong chance we will prove players with a way to find groups for dungeons, as we still don't want solo players to be left completely stranded.<br>
<b><br>
New monster technology</b><br>
All the monsters in Dungeons are special, and almost all of them will have some kind of interesting mechanic. We do not want mobs to be overloaded with moves, we understand "bad" mobs are important, but they should feel more alive than the vanilla Minecraft AI - not everything should act like a zombie!<br>
<br>
Mobs in Minecraft, in general, are very limited, which is why we started working on new technologies to create new kind of mobs. There is so much we can do with them, we can't wait to show them off, and we really hope to catch you guys off guard with our bosses!<br>
<br>
<b>Many different difficulty tiers</b><br>
The Dungeon will have a certain amount of floors, and each floor with a different Boss at the end. Everyone will start on the first floor and will have to beat the floor's boss to unlock the next one. Each floor will be exponentially harder than the last.<br>
<br>
<b>Exploration</b><br>
We want Dungeons to be a constant learning experience. As players run dungeons, they will understand them more and more and become more familiar with the potential layouts. While each Dungeon will have a path going from the entrance to the boss room, players will also be encouraged to venture outside of that path and explore the rest of the Dungeon, solve puzzles, avoid traps, encounter mini-bosses. The more you'll explore the Dungeon, the strongest your team will be when facing the boss.<br>

<br>
<b>Strategy</b><br>
Dungeons will have a learning curve, and while the first couple floors will be simple, you will eventually get your butt kicked, forcing you to go back and improve your gear and skills.<br>
<br>
Five dungeon classes will be introduced on release, each with very specific strengths.<br>
<b><br>
Almost infinite progression</b><br>
Every item found in Dungeons will be new and unique. The Dungeoneering skill will not only level up your classes but also buff your Dungeon items, which will allow us to create monsters extremely strong in the last few floors.<br>
<br>
<b>Rewards</b><br>
Not including drops from mobs, Dungeon Bosses will reward some of the strongest weapons in the game, and powerful item modifiers, such as new reforges, Ultimate Enchantments and more.<br>
<br>
<b>And much more</b><br>
We could go on and talk about the Dungeon Map, exploration-scoring system, salvaging system, shop, dungeon passes, party finder, aggro system, wardrobe, death mechanics and so on, but we have said enough for now!<br>
<br>
<b>Are we done yet?</b><br>
To be completely honest, we do not know when Dungeons will be ready, every day brings a load of new tasks. There are still many mobs on the list, many items, several bosses, many mechanics unfinished. At the end of the day, we want to release when we truly believe Dungeons is a fun and rewarding experience for players.<br>
<br>
While we cannot accurately say when we'll be ready for release yet, we believe a rough estimate places dungeons for late March or early April. Please understand that this could change depending on how we feel about the content as it approaches completion.<br>
<br>
We're very sorry for the wait, but we really want to do things right!
