Hey guys!

SkyBlock has been out for a while now and we are impressed by its success.

We thought we'd share a few of our bug fixes and changes since it's release. Do note that while we've tried to take note of everything we've changed, some of the changes might be missing from these notes.

# General Changes
* Opened game to all players (including non-ranked)
* Minion Slot Unlock Buffs
	* You now need 5 Unique minions to unlock the 6th slot (instead of 10)
	* You now need 10 extra unique minions to unlock the 7th slot (15 total, instead of 25)
	* You now need 15 extra unique minions to unlock the 8th slot (30 total, instead of 50)
	* You now need 20 extra unique minions to unlock the 9th slot (50 total, instead of 75)
	* After 75, you will gain +1 Slot every 25 unique minions, until you reach the cap: 20
