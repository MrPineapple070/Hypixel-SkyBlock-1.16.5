<i>No more accidentally crafting Minecraft recipes with your expensive SkyBlock items!​</i>

## Fixes  
-   Fixed SkyBlock items being used in Minecraft recipes.
-   Fixed a bug where the Recipe menu was constantly being updated when it didn't need to be, causing annoying glitchy item clicking in the inventory.  
-   Dummies cannot be placed inside each other anymore.
-   Fixes Quiver Arrow being put in item frames.
-   Fixed instances where you couldn't pick up the Dummy after it had died. ("This Training Dummy has already been picked up!").
-   Fixed having 2 Bows on the hotbar causing the SkyBlock Menu to be deleted by the Quiver Arrow.
-   Fixed clicking on a Quiver Arrow in your inventory removing the wrong item.
-   Hopefully made the Quiver Arrow appearing on your hotbar after shooting a little snappier.
-   Fixed Raider Axe +25 coins
## Changes  
-   Romero now accepts any tier of Flower Minion.  
-   Melody sells a Personal Harp furniture for those who want to practice/complete songs at home.
