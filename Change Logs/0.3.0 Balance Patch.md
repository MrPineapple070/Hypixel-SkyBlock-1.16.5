Hello,  
  
We made some changes to armors and weapons in the last few days.  
Balancing changes were based on difficulty to obtain, compared to the best gear currently in the game.  
A lot of items were buffed, keep in mind things are still going to change. We are currently working on new items and some of the current set bonus and abilities might change.  
Let us know what you think about the buffs.
