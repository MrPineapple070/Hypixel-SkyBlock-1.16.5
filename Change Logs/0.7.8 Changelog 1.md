A new update to SkyBlock's Pets system has been released including the Taming Skill, New Pets, Pet Items, Upgrading, and more! For information on what changes are included, check out the details below.  
# &#x25B6; Taming Skill and Pet Score  
A new skill has been added to SkyBlock as a companion to the pet's system. Taming XP is granted simply by leveling up pets. Leveling up the skill grants you extra pet XP and **pet luck**, a new stat that increases the chance to find pets in the wild and also increases the chance to craft better pets.  
  
Along with the Taming skill, rewards have been added to collecting unique pets! Each unique pet now gives a score based on its rarity and upon hitting milestones of points you gain permanent **magic find**! Check it out by hovering over the diamond in the pets menu.

# &#x25B6; New Pets  
This update contains **16 new pets** from various areas, we don't want to spoil too much but here are some ways you may find some of the new pets!  
-   Crafting
-   Spooky Event Shop
-   Zoo Event Shop
-   Mobs around Slayer areas
-   Fishing bosses
-   Dark Auction
-   Mining Ore
# &#x25B6;  Pet Items and Candy  
## Pet Items  
A new type of item has been added, Pet items! Pets can now hold specific items that give them **special abilities** or boosts but beware, pets can only hold one item at a time and they're consumed on use!  
  
You can find pet items all across SkyBlock in shops, from killing mobs, and from crafting.  
## Pet Candy  
Is your pet craving a sweet treat? Craft some Pet Candy in the carrot collection and feed it your pet to give it an **instant XP boost**! Just be sure not to overfeed your pet, since they can only fit 10 candies in their bellies. Pet Candy comes in three tiers to cater to whatever financial situation you're in but beware, once your pet has eaten their 10 candy, they can't eat anymore so choose wisely.

# &#x25B6; New NPCs  
A few new NPCs have arrived in town and settled in the Pets Building just west of spawn!  
## Kat the Pet Sitter  
-   Pay Kat to take care of your pet for a while and come back later to collect it once its  **rarity**  has been  **upgraded**

## Zog the Pet Item Vendor  
-   Buy various  **pet items**  to boost your pets!

## George the Pet Collector  
-   **Sell pets**  that need a new home to George for a pretty penny!

# &#x25B6; New Mini-Boss
