## Piggy Bank  
Here's a last bug fix: **Fixed the Piggy Bank opening the full bank menu after depositing**.  
<details>
<summary>Spoiler:  Piggy Bank Details (CLICK)</summary>
We realized this bug/feature has been live for a long time and players are used to it, so we decided to offer an alternative.

First, the Piggy bank now has a new use.
You will not lose coins from death if you have a Piggy Bank in your inventory.
On death, your piggy bank will break. You can repair it for 8 times cheaper than a new one. (it's about 5k coins of pork chops). On break/repair, you still keep the reforge on it.

Second, you can now upgrade the Personal Bank cooldown.
The Personal Bank is unlocked from Emerald Collection VI.
It used to always have a cooldown of 2 hours.
We added 3 upgrade tiers to it, with the top upgrade having a cooldown of.. 0 seconds.
Also, talking to the Banker in the hub resets the Personal Bank cooldown.

"Guy" in the hub (near the Colosseum) can upgrade your personal bank access time.

## Item Pickup Settings  
Some _evil_ players found an epic gamer strategy to spam drop Boats and other "popular" items in the hub.  
This is the answer:

Because this new setting didn't fit in the Settings menu, we re-organized the menu a bit.  
## Teleport Pad Names  
You can now give cute names to your teleport pads on your island.

## Shady stuff going down  
Some of you may know already, but the leader of the _Dark_ auction, Sirius, might not be a totally stand-up guy.  
Two of his _friends_ settled down in the tavern next to the dark auction building in the Wilderness.

## Slayer Tweaks  
-   Slayer boss drops will now guarantee dropping their respective "token" items (flesh, web, teeth). the other more rare drops and runes are on separate drop tables. If the stars align, you can get 3 different drops from a slayer boss.
-   Added slayer XP leaderboards icon (only shows to "veteran" players)
-   Inverted the LVL requirements for Mastiff and Pack Armor
-   Buffed Pack Armor to epic rarity
-   Added decent NPC sell prices for the ~20% drop rate slayer items
-   Foul Flesh is now a fuel for 90% during 5 hours, on top of ingredient for stamina pots.
-   Added Pooch Sword, a serious upgrade to Shaman Sword

## Other general changes  
-   Changed the price of Superboom TNT from 5k to 2.5k
-   Changed Maddox Batphone cooldown from 3 -> 1 minute
-   Reduced combat timer to 5 seconds if no enemies are within 12 blocks
One more thing, you can now kick inactive co-op members after 35 days of inactivity, even in a 2-players co-op.  
Enjoy!
