Hello.  
  
We fixed a bug which prevented some players from joining SkyBlock.  
  
Briefly:  

-   When creating a new profile
-   AND joining a very laggy server
-   AND being unlucky

That new island would become corrupted and couldn't load, preventing players from ever joining again.  
This is now fixed and it deletes the new world.  
  
When the fix happens, it will SPAM the player with warnings explaining this issue.  
We do save all the broken worlds just in case, but the bug should only affect brand new islands.
