Hey Everyone!  
  
While we wait for more bigger content to be completed, here's a fun little update to keep you guys occupied. Read on to see what's new!  
# &#x25B6;  Slayer Quests  
![5da017600d91e.horror.png](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5da017600d91e.horror.png "Revenant Horror")  
If you want to tip your toes into some really challenging content, or if you enjoy incremental progression and theorycrafting, Slayer is where to go.  
  
<center>Find Maddox in the basement of the Tavern in the SkyBlock Hub to do Slayer Quests.</center>

Maddox is a new NPC who lives under the tavern. His quests are fairly simple: Kill X number of monsters, then slay the boss.  
![5da018ceee515.revenant.png](https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5da018ceee515.revenant.png "Revenant Horror III")

Each of the 3 bosses available today are split into 4 increasingly difficult tiers. The highest tier will challenge even the most hardened veterans out there. We recommend obtaining the highest possible skills, best equipment, top potions and some aiming skills before attempting Tier IV.

Plenty of rewards await for those with the discpline to reach the top, including new armor sets fine-tuned against each bosses, new epic accessories, brand new minion types, upgrades, arrow poison, permanent stats, unique perks, tons of items... for a cost!

# &#x25B6;  Bank Upgrades  
Players will soon have interesting things to buy, but in the meantime, banks are growing and it is time to introduce Bank Upgrades!  
  
Bank interests can now only stack up to 2 times, in case profiles are offline for a very long time.  
  
Bank interests now work based on the total amount of coins currently in the bank.  
From 0 coins to 10 million coins: 2% interest  
From 10 million coins to 20 million coins: 1% interest  
From 20 million coins to 30 million coins: 0.5% interest  
From 30 million coins to 50 million coins: 0.2% interest  
From 50 million coins to 160 million coins: 0.1% interest  
  
Bank interests are now capped based on Bank Upgrades:

# &#x25B6;  SkyBlock API  
We recently released the [SkyBlock API](https://github.com/HypixelDev/PublicAPI/tree/master/Documentation/methods/skyblock), which will allow content creators to make very useful websites.  
By default some of your stats are turned ON or OFF by default, you can now find those options and toggle them in your SkyBlock Settings.  
## A note on future content:  
As most of you already know, we are currently working on Dungeons.  
Dungeons require new technologies and features we never used before, and while we are making good progress, it should not come as a surprise that the very first Dungeon will take a lot longer to create than the next ones.  
The closer we get to release, the more infos we will give you.  
The next SkyBlock patch will be 0.7.3 and will feature more content, unrelated to Dungeons, and is expected to release within 2 to 3 weeks.  
  
As always, thank you for playing SkyBlock on Hypixel!
