Hey Guys,  
  
Today I bring you some small changes/bug fixes.  
-   Reduce the priority of Armor, Weapons, and Tools in the quick crafting menu to stop them from overriding the resources players are more often crafting
-   Give Diver set 2% sea creature chance per-piece, give angler 1% sea creature chance per-piece instead of the set bonus
    -   **Developer Note:**  Diver set wasn't seeing enough use for being the end-game fishing set, this should give it some much-needed strength over Angler. The Angler change is so players can swap out each piece of their Angler set as they collect Diver pieces.
-   Fix Endermite not munching pearls all the time
-   Fix quiver changes not applying to telekinesis
-   Fix Echolocation perk not showing up in the player menu
