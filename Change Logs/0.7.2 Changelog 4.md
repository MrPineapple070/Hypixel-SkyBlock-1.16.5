Hello.  
  
Last Tuesday we rolled a patch to fix a bug with Revenant & Tarantula armor's Bulwark effect not applying their defense bonus against boss abilities. The patch had the side effect of crashing servers and everything catching on fire.  
  
We now have a resolution for the initial bug and we picked up a few goodies along the way.  
  
## Bugfixes  
-   Damage/stat modifiers now correctly apply against enemy abilities. This includes Revenant/Tarantula Bulwark, but also  _many_  other things. _For example, did you know Resistance potion's defense bonus didn't work against Pestilence?_
-   Spiked Hook was dealing +250% damage instead of +25%
-   Cleave Enchant was only dealing 3% damage regardless of level, now properly does 15%. Also, it was sort of dealing random damage, now it should hit properly for 15% damage at rank V.
-   Fixed Leaping Sword multiplying the player's crit damage stat by 1.25 instead of adding +25%.

## Changes  
-   **Abilities/enchants now don't apply invulnerability ticks on mobs. This includes Pigman's sword Burning Souls, but also Thorns, Venomous...  ![:eek:](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Eek!    :eek:")** 
-   Fixed Extreme Focus on End Stone Sword so the resistance bonus doesn't go away on the first hit. Also added some sfx to it.

## Slayer  
-   Normalized the Slayer XP required for Broodfather & Packmaster LVLs so they're the same as Zombie.
-   Reduced the insane damage of dark-red mini-bosses. They still hit hard, but half as much.
-   Added a minute to Sven's time limit.

We updated our tools to better investigate effects of items/enchants/perks on damage.  
Here's a glimpse:

We may eventually release a nicer-looking version of this debugging information to players as a feature.
