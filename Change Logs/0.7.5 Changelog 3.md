-   Made it more clear that there are multiple rounds
-   Made it more clear when the event is over
-   Fixed a couple issues with the mountain animation

-   Fixed some abilities being able to damage the magma cubes
-   Reduced the amount of white and green gifts rewarded by the event
-   Changed the ratios of many rewards
-   Reduced the amount of coins rewarded
-   Players who deal little damage now get less rewards
-   Frail enchantment won't apply to Grinches anymore
-   Fixed some white gift locations

-   Added a few penguins on the map
-   Boosted the rates of Snow Suit Helmets until the 23rd
